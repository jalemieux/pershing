# Passwordless Email Authentication System PRD

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a passwordless authentication system using email verification codes. This system will provide a more user-friendly and secure alternative to traditional password-based authentication.

## User Flow

### 1. Initial Login/Registration Page
- Single input field for email address
- "Continue with Email" button
- No distinction between login and registration (unified flow)

### 2. Email Verification Flow
1. User enters their email address
2. System generates a 6-digit verification code
3. System sends verification code to user's email
4. User is redirected to code verification page
5. User enters the verification code
6. System validates the code and authenticates the user

### 3. Session Management
- After successful verification, user receives a session token
- Session remains active for 30 days by default
- User can choose "Remember this device" option to extend session to 90 days

## Technical Requirements

### Email Verification Code
- 6-digit numeric code
- Code expires after 10 minutes
- Maximum 3 invalid attempts before requiring new code
- Rate limiting: maximum 5 code requests per email per hour

### Security Requirements
- All verification codes must be hashed before storage
- Implement rate limiting on both email sending and code verification endpoints
- Use secure session management with HTTP-only cookies
- Implement CSRF protection on all forms
- All API endpoints must use HTTPS

### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- New tables required

CREATE TABLE verification_codes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    code_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    attempts INT DEFAULT 0,
    used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    session_token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    device_info TEXT
);
```

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Initiate Authentication
```
POST /auth/initiate
Request:
{
    "email": "user@example.com"
}
Response:
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Verification code sent",
    "session_id": "temp-session-id"
}
```

#### 2. Verify Code
```
POST /auth/verify
Request:
{
    "session_id": "temp-session-id",
    "code": "123456",
    "remember_device": boolean
}
Response:
{
    "success": true,
    "user": {
        "id": "user-id",
        "email": "user@example.com"
    }
}
```

### Email Template Requirements
- Clean, minimal design
- Clear presentation of verification code
- Company branding
- Security notice
- Code expiration time
- Anti-phishing guidance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Authentication
- Basic email verification system
- Session management
- Essential security features

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security
- Rate limiting
- Device fingerprinting
- Suspicious activity detection

### Phase 3: User Experience
- Email template improvements
- Progressive web app support
- Remember device functionality

## Success Metrics
- User adoption rate
- Authentication success rate
- Average time to authenticate
- Failed verification attempts
- Support ticket volume related to authentication

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all core functions
- Integration tests for the complete authentication flow
- Load testing for concurrent authentication requests
- Security penetration testing
- Email delivery testing across major providers

## Compliance Requirements
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Data retention policies
- User consent management
- Privacy policy updates

## Dependencies
- Email service provider integration
- Database modifications
- Session management system
- Rate limiting infrastructure
- Security monitoring tools

## Rollout Strategy
1. Internal testing phase (2 weeks)
2. Beta testing with 10% of new users (2 weeks)
3. Gradual rollout to existing users (4 weeks)
4. Full production deployment

## Future Considerations
- SMS verification as backup
- WebAuthn/FIDO2 integration
- OAuth provider integration
- Multi-device management
- Account recovery process
